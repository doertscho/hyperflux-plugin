The Hyperflux project
=====================

Hyperflux is a Scala framework and compiler plugin that helps you create web applications with Scala seamlessly. It is built upon the Scala.js compiler plugin which creates JavaScript from Scala code.

Hyperflux, at this point, is a one-person project (Hi, my name is Stefan). I'm working on it as an essential part of my M.Sc. thesis at the university of Kiel, Germany.

This repo contains the plugin for the Scala compiler. It integrates into the chain of compiler phases and performs several transformations that are required for working with the Hyperflux programming model.
